### Hello adventurer 👋
I'm Mohamad! My fascination with programming began at age 12, starting with QBasic and Visual Basic. During my mathematics studies at university, I embraced Python 🐍 and MATLAB, continually connecting theoretical knowledge with practical applications. More recently, I've been enhancing my technical skills at "42" coding school, focusing on C, Linux 🐧, and Shell.

This GitHub hosts primarily educational projects from "42," showcasing my ongoing learning and my efforts to deepen my understanding of complex programming concepts. Take a look around to see my progress and explorations in the tech world!


Skills I'm currently sharpening: 🔨  C
                                🐧  Linux
                                🌿  GIT
                                🐍  Python
                                🤖  C++ (WIP)

- 🔭 I’m currently learning C++ for the first time.
- 🌱 I’m currently improving my skills in Python.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Gaming and coding can produce equal amount of dopamine.
